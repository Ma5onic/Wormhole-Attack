# Wormhole-Attack
This is an experimental implementation of the wormhole attack on Linux. It targets WLAN multi-hop and mesh networks. In particularly, it is an attack on the routing protocol in those networks. It has been successfully tested to attack OLSR, BATMAN, BATMAN-ADV, HWMP despite IEEE802.1i/s security. For more information refer to www.paser.info.
Step-by.step documentation will be added soon. For now, an example scenario and supporting scripts are attached.
