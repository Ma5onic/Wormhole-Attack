# Wormhole-Attack
This is an experimental implementation of the wormhole attack on Linux. It targets WLAN multi-hop and mesh networks. In particularly, it is an attack against the routing protocol in those networks. It has been successfully tested to attack OLSR, BATMAN, BATMAN-ADV, HWMP routing protcols, despite the IEEE802.1i/s security. For more information refer to www.paser.info.

Step-by.step documentation will be added soon. For now, an example scenario and supporting scripts are attached.

Some code portions are based on the https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng project.
